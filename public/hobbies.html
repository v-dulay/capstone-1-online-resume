<h1>These are some of my hobbies</h1>
<h2>Gaming</h2>
<p>Gaming has always been one of my favorite pastimes, offering both relaxation and excitement. I particularly enjoy Marvel Rivals, where I can immerse myself in the universe of superheroes while strategizing to outplay my opponents. In VALORANT, the competitive environment hones my focus, quick reflexes, and teamwork skills as I collaborate with others to achieve victory. These games not only entertain but also challenge me to think critically and improve with every match.</p>

<h2>Sports</h2>
<p>Basketball is more than just a sport to me—it’s a way to stay active, push my limits, and connect with others. Whether it’s a casual game with friends or a competitive match, I find joy in every dribble, pass, and shot. It’s a great outlet for energy and a source of discipline and perseverance.</p>

<h2>Leisure</h2>
<p>In my leisure time, I find happiness in sharing meals and discovering new cuisines with my girlfriend. Exploring different flavors and dishes brings us closer together and creates lasting memories. For me, food is more than sustenance—it’s an experience that connects people and tells a story, and I love being part of that journey.</p>
